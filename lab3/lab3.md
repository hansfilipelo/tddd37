# Inference rules

These rules will be referred to in this lab.

1. If X âŠ‡ Y then XY, or X  X (reflexive rule)
2. XY |= XZ  YZ (augmentation rule)
3. X  Y, Y  Z |= X  Z (transitive rule)
4. X  YZ |= X  Y (decomposition rule)
5. X  Y, X  Z |= X  YZ (union or additive rule)
6. X  Y, WY  Z |= WX  Z (pseudotransitive rule)

# Assignments

**1.**

a)

b)

c)

**2.**

a)

$$ F={{AB->C}; {A->D}; {D->AE}; {E->F}} $$

Which gives:

$$ A->D
